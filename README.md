# Giphy-API
https://damonkd.github.io/Giphy-API/

Gets ten animimated gif objects from giphy and displays them in still mode. Clicking an image starts the animation, clicking again stops it.

New animals can be added using the add animal button and input field.

The challenge was to get ten animated images from a search term loaded into the html, then click on the image to start the animation. I used ajax to query the API, jquery to target and dynamically create the buttons, as well as the search option to add another button.
